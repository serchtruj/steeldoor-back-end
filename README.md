To get started with this API, you'll need to have Node.js  (https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Once you have that set up, you can clone this repository and run the following command to install the dependencies:

### `npm install`

Now you can run the project in dev mode:

Runs the app in the development mode using nodemon.\

The page will reload when you make changes.
